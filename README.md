when "ModuleB" is selected as scheme, the preview from "ModuleBView" including the image works as expected.

But when "ModuleA" is selected, the preview from "ModuleAView" (which includes ModuleBView" does not work, the PreviewAgent crashes. But as soon as the line with the image in "ModuleBView" is removed, the preview from "ModuleAView" also works.
